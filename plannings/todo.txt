2. Active (Ability)
    2.1 Copier (카피얼)
        - Ability to copy other players' active abilities.
          Depending on the proficiency, the ability holder can
          copy more and diverse/high ranked abilities.
        - How to get?
            Use 10,000 Life in Ability Shop

3. Passive (Ability)
    3.1 Mirroring (미러링)
        - I don't think this can be really implemented properly, given the minecraft's context.
          So I think it'd be the best if we did "mirrors the damage if the player intakes a death-amount damage"
    3.2 Natural Healing (자연 치유)
        - I don't think this can be really implemented properly, given the minecraft's context.
          So I think it'd be the best if we did "fully heals the player when they intake a death-amount damage"
